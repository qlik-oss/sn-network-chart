# sn-network-chart

A network chart to be used with nebula.js, built using [visjs network visualization](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network) to display networks of nodes and edges.

## Requirements

Requires `@nebula.js/stardust` version `1.7.0` or later.

## Installing

If you use npm: `npm install @nebula.js/sn-network-chart`.

You can also load through the script tag directly from [https://unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/@nebula.js/sn-network-chart).

## Usage

```js
import { embed } from '@nebula.js/stardust';
import network from '@nebula.js/sn-network-chart';

// 'app' is an enigma app model
const nuked = embed(app, {
  types: [
    {
      // register grid chart - qlik-network-chart is the default name in sense
      name: 'qlik-network-chart',
      load: () => Promise.resolve(network),
    },
  ],
});

// Rendering a simple network chart
nuked.render({
  element: document.querySelector('.network'),
  type: 'qlik-network-chart',
  fields: ['Source', 'Target', '=Sum(Flow)'],
  properties: {
    title: 'Visualization of network flows',
  },
});
```

## Data sample

Check `resources/Network data.xlsx` for an example. The simplest data form is where each row represents an edge in the network. Take this example of airport connections:

| AirportID | AirportName    | LinkToId | Volume |
|-----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| 0         | Soekarno-Hatta | 3        | 23000  |
| 1         | Halim          | 0        | 5460   |
| 2         | Changi         | 0        | 10870  |
| 3         | KLCC           | 1        | 2780   |
| 4         | Don Muang      | 1        | 4800   |
| 4         | Don Muang      | 2        | 7800   |

Sense inline load script example:

```
Load * Inline [
AirportID, AirportName, LinktoID,Volume
0,Soekarno-Hatta,3,23000
1,Halim,0,5460
2,Changi,0,10870
3,KLCC,1,2780
4,Don Muang,1,4800
4,Don Muang,2,7800
];
```
